Hello! Welcome to my blog. My name is Taylor Walenczyk. I am an outdoors enthusiast currently living in the Salt Lake City area. While in college, I began taking trips to our National Parks with friends. This interest quickly blossomed into a passion. After completing my studies, I completed the Colorado Trail with Sarah, my then girlfriend. In the subsequent years, I took any opportunity I could manage to travel in the mountains: backpacking parts of the Wind River High Route; traveling by foot from Utah to Flagstaff, AZ, in winter; and completing the Alta Via 2 in northeastern Italy over the course of two trips. I have been blessed to travel far and wide, and to have lived in a several different places and two continents.
