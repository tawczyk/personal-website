excerpt: "After settling into a rhythm in SLC, Sarah and I decided to finally get out for a weekend of backpacking. Back in 2021, we completed the Uinta Highline Trail (UHT). We fell in love with that most intriguing most range spanning east-west across northern Utah. We had been itching to return to the range, so it was an easy decision to venture back there for our first backpacking excursion as locals."
