After enjoying the first snow cycle since Thanksgiving, my motivation to train has returned in full. The week began cold and overcast, but largely dry, leading to fair conditions for running on the local trails.

## Monday

Bouldering at Momentum for an hour. Unstructured time in the studio. Lifted aftwards for ~30 minutes, targeting legs.

## Tuesday

Trainer ride for 30 minutes. Relaxed spin just to get the mojo back (and spin out some of the soreness in my legs from the prior day's lift). Low average power ~128W.

## Wednesday

Trainer ride for 30 minutes. Another easy session intended to warm up the legs for a trail run. Average power ~117W. (Pushing power isn't hard right now, it's just staying the saddle). Trail run afterwards, ~5km out and back on Sensei, ~500 vertical feet and a good pace at ~12 minutes per mile.

## Thursday

## Friday

## Saturday

## Sunday
